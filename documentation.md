## Introduction

Activity Buddies is a web app designed to help students find and connect with activities and groups that match their interests and schedule. With Activity Buddies, you can create your groups for various activities, join activities created by other users, and communicate with other members through message features. The app is built using React framework, Tailwind, and Vite and is hosted on Firebase. The app uses Firebase Authentication to allow students to easily sign up, log in, and log out, and Cloud Firestore for storing and retrieving data. The app also includes various libraries and plugins, such as React Router, React Bootstrap, and @emotion/css, to enhance the user experience and functionality.

One of the key features of Activity Buddies is the ability to search for activities based on various criteria, such as date, location, and interests. This makes it easy to find activities that match your schedule and interests, regardless of what activity you enjoy.

Another feature of Activity Buddies is creating your own activity and adding various tags, such as running, swimming, jogging, etc. This allows you to organise your activities and connect with others who share your interests. You can also join activities created by other users, allowing you to discover and connect with new groups that match your interests.

You can communicate with other group members through chat and message features, making it easy to stay connected and share information with your group, even if you're not physically together.

Activity Buddies is a great tool for students who want to find and connect with activities and groups that match their interests and schedule. With its user-friendly interface, easy-to-use features, and personalised group recommendations, Activity Buddies makes that very easy.

## Methodology

Activity Buddies was built using the Design Thinking methodology. This approach emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and iterative problem-solving, providing a structured framework for understanding user needs, generating innovative solutions, and testing and refining those solutions based on user feedback. Applying Design Thinking principles ensures that this single-page application is user-centred and effectively caters to university students' unique needs and preferences.

## Methods

To evaluate the proposed methodology, the following data collection methods were used:
User surveys: Surveys were distributed to gather quantitative feedback from a representative user base. The survey questions were designed to assess user satisfaction, usability, and the perceived effectiveness of the task management application. Surveys allowed for collecting a large amount of data in a relatively short time frame.
User interviews: Selected users were interviewed to gain qualitative insights into their experiences and perceptions of the application. Interviews provided an opportunity to delve deeper into users' thoughts, motivations, and specific pain points, complementing the survey data.

Each data collection method was chosen to comprehensively understand the solution's usability, user satisfaction, and overall effectiveness. Combining quantitative and qualitative data allowed for a holistic evaluation of the solution's performance and user experience.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the following key findings and results were obtained:
User satisfaction: The activity application received positive feedback from the user base, with a majority expressing satisfaction with its features and functionality. Users appreciated the ability to create and participate in various activities, collaborate with other students, and efficiently manage their involvement in different events.

User engagement: The application successfully fostered user engagement by providing a platform for students to explore and participate in various activities. Users reported increased involvement in extracurricular and academic activities, leading to a more vibrant and connected student community.
Iterative development: By applying the Design Thinking methodology, we incorporated user feedback and iteratively refined the application. This approach allowed us to address user requirements and continuously improve the user experience. User stories and iterations played a crucial role in guiding the development process and ensuring that the application met the needs of its users.
Data collection methods: To evaluate the solution, we employed various methods, including surveys and user interviews. Surveys provided quantitative feedback, while interviews allowed for qualitative insights and a deeper understanding of user perspectives. User behaviour analysis helped identify usage patterns and areas for improvement.

Findings and improvements: The evaluation revealed positive user experiences and indicated that the application effectively facilitated student activities and engagement. However, some areas for improvement were identified, such as enhancing the user interface, providing clearer activity descriptions, and streamlining the process of creating and managing activities. These findings will inform future iterations and updates to enhance the application's usability and user satisfaction.
In conclusion, the Activity Buddies application, developed using the Design Thinking methodology, proved to be a valuable platform for students to discover, create, and participate in various activities. The iterative development process and user-centric approach allowed us to address user needs and continuously refine the application.

Looking at the future, it is important to incorporate the identified improvements to enhance the user interface, streamline activity creation and management, and provide clearer information to users. Ongoing user feedback and engagement will further strengthen the application and ensure its continued success in facilitating student activities and promoting a vibrant campus environment.
